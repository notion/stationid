Prototype replaces document.getElementsByClassName with it's own version. However many browsers
now come with their own implementation, and prototype's is much slower.

This fixes this by restoring the original after prototype is loaded.

@todo: Safari 3 used to come with a broken document.getElementsByClassName. We should use
the same checks jQuery does and not restore the function if it doesn't work the same as the spec.
